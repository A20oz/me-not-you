We started with cocktails at the bar around 7:00 and were ignored by the bartenders for a long time.  \nOnce we sat down at a table, the service was so slow, we spent the majority of our night waiting for our waitress.  We ordered fondue but found out that it wasn't served past 8:00.  If we would have known that, we would not have wasted time at the bar.  That is a large part of the menu and to take that away so early seems silly.  The worst part is that nowhere on the menu does it say that fondue isn't served into the night, so we ordered a bottle of wine and felt as if we were obligated to order dinner even though all we wanted to do was leave.  We watched other patrons get fondue after we tried to order it.  We felt as if we were lied to.\nWe attempted to order ravioli and then found out that the kitchen had run out.  The waitress should have told us this when we sat down.  We decided on appetizer of bruschetta and pizza margherita.  We waited for our food forever, long enough to nearly finish our bottle of wine.  The appetizer came at the same time as dinner, and they were both disappointing.  Neither of the dishes were prepared in the way that is typical; both tasted pathetic.  If the menu says there are tomatoes on a pizza and basil on the bruschetta, there should be tomatoes on a pizza and basil on the bruschetta!\nThe bar staff was slow, the waitress was slow, the menu was misleading, the winelist was non-existent.  The hostess was nice and the pianists were entertaining.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  In fact, I would recommend that people run in the opposite direction.", "review_text_best": "I don't even know where to start other than saying that my experience here was absolutely awful.  Bear with me, this is going to be a long review because there is a lot I need to warn you about.\n\nThe decor in the place is upscale but done with cheap materials like laminate floors and tables.  It requires one to ignore the terrible location and Hallmark store across the way to truly enjoy the ambiance.  One must also try to ignore the staff, who are dressed like they are either working the streets or living on them.  It's never a good sign when the (few) patrons are dressed appropriately and the staff is not.  The \"Whorestess,\" as we dubbed the hostess due to her painted on jeans and ginormous silver snake skin shoes, walked us halfway through the place then started to giggle and exclaimed \"Oh my gosh!  That table doesn't even exist!\" and then hiked us back to the hostess stand to find one that did.  She then tried to seat us about 6 inches from the stage and pianist, even though the place was pretty much empty.  We asked her for a table that wouldn't require asking the musician to pass the salt, and got a table next to the bus stand where a group of hooched and scruffy staff were playing grab ass and comparing notes on their tips from the night before.  \n\nOrdered the cheese fondue, which they made table side.  Very uncomfortable having a ditzy waitress standing at the table cooking when you're trying to have a conversation.  She gave us a play by play of what she was doing like it was some public access cooking show.  Very weird.  At one point, she cranked up the heat, dumped in some wine and lemon juice and then disappeared for the first of many times.  She eventually came back, continued the show with the little bit of liquid that hadn't evaporated and put the fondue in a huge pot that was well above eye level, which made it very difficult to eat and kept us from seeing that there was nowhere near enough fondue for two people (you can only order for couples) and that the fondue was burning and crusting all over the pot.  Because there was so little fondue in the pot, it got very hot very quickly and I ended up burning my mouth.  The fondue was served with stale bread (sliced, not cubed), brown apple slices with stems and seeds, broccoli florets with dried out brown edges and \"roasted\" potatoes that were dry and practically frozen in the middle.  The serving was appetizer size rather than enough to be an entree for two people, so my husband kindly let me eat the fondue and grilled out when we got home.  Other tables seemed to get better portions, so it seems they aren't measuring the ingredients and you just have to hope that you don't get a stingy server. \n\nWe'd also ordered the $7 asparagus appetizer, which the menu said was baked. The pathetic little pile of limp asparagus was actually fried and incredibly greasy and so tough I couldn't bite through them.  \n\nFinished up the meal with chocolate fondue, which actually tasted pretty good, but wasn't really fondue.  It's just chocolate sauce (Hershey's syrup, maybe?) in a raised bowl with a votive candle underneath to give the illusion of being a fondue.  For $11, I'd skip it and go around the corner for some chocolates from Art Mart instead.\n\nIn addition to the bad service and terrible food, the atmosphere was also pretty unpleasant.  There is a pianist which you'd think would give it an upscale feel.  But that's contradicted by the TVs all over the place playing baseball games.  It's almost as if they looked around and said \"Oh my gosh!  We don't want this place to be classy - better rock the ESPN and have everyone show up to work in wrinkly polo shirts and torn, dirty jeans!\"  It is also marketing itself as a bachelorette party destination, meaning that halfway through our dinner, a large group of drunk women with plastic penis necklaces got seated next to us and pretty much ruined any shred of a nice meal that may have remained.  The place is pretty small and the tables are all fairly close together, so be prepared to get to know your neighbors whether you want to or not.  We also got treated to the lovely acrid odor of a server burning a fondue to a crisp and nonetheless serving it to the unhappy looking couple two tables over.\n\nOverall, this was a very negative experience from start to finish.  Basically, it's an over decorated off campus Kam's that's making a half assed attempt at food service.  I would highly recommend that you avoid 88 Broadway, which shouldn't be too hard since it's in a dead mall.\n\n88 is also responsible for getting Bill, the friendly harmless homeless gentleman who is a fixture of downtown Urbana, banned from Lincoln Square Mall where he often goes (went) to escape the elements.

While I miss the presence of Espresso Royals in the Union, Starbucks never lets me down when it comes to yummy drinks with quick, courteous service. This location is pretty sweet, smack in the center of the Union on Green. Most quad traffic comes through this place and the hotel upstairs provides a stream of willing, tired travelers. However, I came to this little pit stop on a Saturday morning at 9am. Not only are students still snuggled abed, most travelers are up and headed to whatever event they are here for. That is to say there was no line and nobody anywhere near the Starbucks. This feat is practically unheard of! So that means I can stroll up (just in time to hear a girl chew them out about her bagel) and order my first, and probably only, pumpkin spice latte of the season. The young man took my order and whipped up my drink by the time I stepped to the left. He not only spelled my name right (that never happens) but said it right! I'm always ready to add sugar or cinnamon to my drinks but this latte was perfect. I didn't do a thing to it and am currently sipping my way to happiness. Add the comfy faux leather chairs in the courtyard and I'm good. I won't complain about prices here. We all know coffee is a luxury good.

We are foodies, and we love Southern cooking and Louisiana food in particular, the spicier the better. We've long been fans of Cajun cooking shows (Justin Wilson was a favorite), and we've cooked from them and more over the years. We're good cooks, but don't often have the time during the week to devote to something slow cooked and layered in flavor. So we were hopeful.\n\nFirst, the pros: We found the place clean and well staffed, with a pretty, bright, themed decor. Cajun music was playing, but not too loudly. The staff were very nice, very professional. \n\nNext, the cons: The food is not good. \n\nThe best thing we ate was the appetizer. We ordered the hush puppies, which came with a remoulade. We received 5 hush puppies and a remoulade for dipping. The remoulade tasted like traditional Midwestern potato salad dressing. The hush puppies were good, although slightly underdone in the middle.\n\nWe next had salads with house-made dressing. The salads were iceberg lettuce with sliced tomato on a plate. The lettuce was not fully drained, the tomato lacked flavor. The house-made dressing tasted like the plain, unseasoned base. The blue cheese and green goddess were indistinguishable from one another in taste or appearance.\n\nFor entrees, we both had the triple sampler: red beans and rice, jumbalaya, and gumbo. The three portions came in approximately 8 oz. diner soup cups on a plate, with a small but decent hoecake. All three were watery, unseasoned, and lacked developed flavor or any attempt at spice / heat. The red beans and rice had no pork flavor in the broth, and there was no hint of garlic or cayenne (let alone the trinity). The whole had not been cooked down until the beans were creamy. The beans and rice together had a slippery texture. The jumbalaya was equally watery, with no chicken or sausage (you can pick one or the other, which begs the question of whether the meat is cooked in the pot to develop flavor or added at the end -- a sin -- or in our case left out altogether). The gumbo was just a hint better than utterly bland. The brown roue had slightly thickened the flavorless broth. But in each dish, the vegetables hadn't had time to develop flavor or even soften much -- the whole dish had certainly not come together. We found ourselves dousing dishes in the spice blend (seasoned salt) and hot sauce (although even that was not too hot) available at the table.\n\nOne last disappointment with these entrees: We both asked for shrimp to be added on top of our dishes (for an extra charge -- or, you can ask for crawfish instead), but the shrimp was unseasoned, flavorless popcorn shrimp out of a can. I find their texture and appearance repulsive (even though I love bigger sized shrimp), so that was especially disappointing.\n\nSeeking redemption, we finished with pie. My husband had the raspberry, and I had the pecan. Both are made fresh on site and served warm. The pies were runny. The pecan had decent flavor, but seemed under-stuffed. There wasn't much to the piece. The raspberry, my husband said, tasted as if it had been made with canned filling rather than fresh fruit, more like vague red-berry goo than raspberry. It was also runny and under-stuffed. There are better pies locally, such as the old Pies by Inge at Monticello's Brown Bag or the ones that are made by a local lady for the Arcade Diner in Paxton.\n\nThe coffee that went with the pie was very good.\n\nThe meal cost around $50. It was not a great value for the money, even if it had been better. Given the quality of the cooking, I'm sorry to say we won't be back.\n\nPerhaps the food's poor preparation accounts for the lack of business tonight -- the dining room had only a couple of tables occupied when we arrived and was nearly as empty when we left.\n\nI'm sorry to put in a bad review.

After a lengthy visit with their estimator (Calvin), who pushed other services and repeat visits hard, I also agreed to have them deep clean the rooms with the tile floors and clean 2 upstairs bathrooms.\n\nShort Answer:   They didn't clean the floors; they did a shoddy job on the work they DID do; they made and then blew off several appointments to fix the issue.\n\nFull Story: When the of two arrived (15 minutes late) to clean the tile floors and as a bonus, clean my kitchen, laundry room and bathrooms, the first person we spoke with complained loudly that she'd been given bad directions. \n\nOnce in the house, she asked to be led to the basement, where she'd been told she'd be working. We don't have a basement. \nI went over the plan with the Loud Woman, (thoroughly clean the tile floors, and while there also do a full clean on the rooms that had them, then clean the upstairs bathrooms).  They started with the bathrooms.\n\nWhen they came downstairs, I had to go over the plan again.  They were to seriously clean the tile floor, and additionally, to clean the rooms rooms that have tile floors.\n\nFinally, after \"cleaning\" everything but the main goal (the tile floors), they went to the laundry room.  There, they were surprised to discover that we needed them to move some stuff so that they could thoroughly clean the whole floor.  I helped them move the washer and dryer.  When I went to move them back after they had allegedly cleaned the laundry room floor, I began to realize that we were in more trouble than a bit of confusion over the scope of the work.\n\nThat floor is tile, with wide grout, over which a dog runs many times a day to go in and out of her dog door. I've cleaned this floor.  At the best of times, it needs a scrub brush to get the grout clean, and indeed, since the tile is highly textured, to get the tiles clean.  These are not the best of times.  In addition to the dog trail (that place where she manages to drop mud before it makes it into the rest of the house), there was plenty of dirt from a humidifier leak and it's subsequent repair. The floor was filthy.\n\nThe Loud Woman had \"cleaned\" it with a cloth and a Mr. Clean solution.  Cloth. No brushes. No scrubby sponges.  \n\nSo, the floor, which was our primary reason for calling the Cleaning Company, was being surface wiped, not CLEANED.\n\nThree hours into their \"visit\" they asked me whether they needed to move the wicker furniture in the sunroom.  How is one supposed to clean a floor without moving the furniture that sits on it?   It was then that I finally discovered that had not been told they needed to do more than mop the floor. (Mopping these floors is a waste of time, it leaves the deep/wide grout full of dirt).  They didn't even have scrub brushes with them.  \n\nI called Calvin. We talked.  He talked to the Loud Woman.  She opined that it would take them four or five hours to get the floor clean.  Calvin came to the house to talk to me, to work out a solution.  The first thing he did was to try to tell me that we had a communication problem, and that he hadn't understood that I'd wanted the floors thoroughly cleaned; that he thought we just wanted a basic clean on those rooms.  When I pointed out that the only thing I'd WANTED was to have the tile floor scrubbed, he relented\n\nAt 5:00, he sent the team home.  He got my bucket and my scrub brushes and set out to clean the floors himself (in his office clothes).  I asked him to send someone the next day who was actually prepared to clean.  He made a call and said he could have a team here in the morning -- BEFORE 8:30 when I had to leave for work.  \n\nAt 8:28, no one had shown up.  I called, they were \"on the way\". At 8:40 I left, no one showed.  I called and talked to the district manager. He was embarrassed and swore this isn't the way they do business.\n\nHe agreed to meet me the next day.  When he came, I was able to show him all of the many ways that the first team had not even met the standards of a regular clean (per their website), much less the deep clean they were to do. (That would take several paragraphs to describe) He promised a team Monday at noon.  Monday morning he changed that to 2:00.  At 10, they changed it to 1:00.   At 1:00 they said 2:00 again.  At 2:00 it became 3:00 and I gave up.\n\nIn the end, they cost me two full days (during which I could not do MY business because one can't see clients at home when there is loud cleaning going on), and hours of fruitless conversations.

I was new to the C-U and Timothy John is very close to where I live. I had driven by numerous times and really liked the way it looked--very open and modern with lots of windows. I assumed because Tim is the owner with lots of experience, he would give me a very good haircut. My hair was well past my shoulders. I like to wear it long and I was growing out some long layers and wanted my hair cut to just at or below my shoulders ALL ONE LENGTH. Very simple. \n\nI said all this to Tim during the consultation and no sooner was I done speaking it became very clear that he ignored everything I said and went scissor and layer happy. \nNext thing I knew he lifted a big section of my hair straight up  (that means you're getting layers), when hair is cut one-length the stylist doesn't lift sections up during the cut. He lifted a section of hair and before I could blink 7 inches were in my lap. I wanted to cry, but once the first snips are taken there is no turning back. The final cut was nothing like what I asked for. Remember one-length? I got layers with bangs.  It was above my shoulders and so layered with big round bangs that looked like they were set in a huge roller. Btw I don't wear bangs. He styled it in the stupidest way possible. It looked like a news broadcaster's helmet haircut. It was like a Saturday Night Live version of a bad \"soccer mom\" cut. \n\nJust because a hairstylist is experienced doesn't mean they are current. They could be giving clients the same bad cut for years. Tim needs to get out of the 80s and re-train. What he gave me was such a far cry from a sleek modern cut.

The stylists that own and operate this place used to work at the Boric's in Urbana (next to the county market), and they are pretty good at what they do. I was surprised to see them in this place, since I knew they are both good at what they do. The difference, of course, is that here they don't have to pay the franchise fee, which could be as high as 60%! The result was that my stylist (Jenny, which I highly recommend her work) took her time and paid lots of attention to what she was doing to my hair, while I always felt rushed when going to Borics, super cuts, etc. with lots of machine cutting.\n\nThey make a point to keep their prices the same as national chains, so an adult haircut is $13, which is very reasonable. They run coupons in local magazines and ads, and Jenny told me that they would even accept competitor coupons as long as it brings them business. \n\nOne small point: It's better if you call and make an appointment.

I had time to kill after work, so I'd go get my haircut every other Tuesday at Borics (by schnucks) by Kelli. She was doing my hair 26 times a year for about 5 years. When she was gone, I'd have Jen do it. Then Kelli left Borics. Jen then became my regular stylist. Then, one day I got the sad news that Jen would also be leaving borics, and who the hell was gonna cut my hairs??? Everyone was like \"let the kridz cut it\" and i'm like \"I've had professionals mess it up, why am I going to have an amateur touch my head\" (and seriously, a Mohawk isn't the easiest thing to do, if you mess up on one side, you need to even it out, then suddenly you have a quarter inch strip on your head, and it's like why even bother). \nThen Jen told me the good news that she and Les would be opening a place down the street. \nThis filled my heart with joy. \nSo, when they opened, I started going there. \nJen is awesome, she's been my primary stylist for at least 3 years now. Les does a good job on my head when Jen is missing. \nSo, now, Kelli is playing pool and I see her every now and then when her team has to play at Jupiters. \nFor some reason, the parking lot is the most deceptive thing in the world. There are like 8 spots out front, and with 2 or 3 or 4 stylists working, some of the spots are taken. But everytime I drive past and the lot is empty, I go inside and it's packed. Then, when my hair is so friggin long that i look like curious George (a grey haired curious George now) and I just can't deal with it anymore, I'll drive past and the lot is full and i'm like \"well, i really need a haircut, so i'll wait\" and I go in and there's no one else in the place. \nIt's right across the street from one of my favorite gas stations too. \nThey are closed on Monday's and do appointment only, and they really don't like to do those appointments... but once I was in desperate need of a trim, and Jen came in on her day off to do my hairz.

For years, Corkscrew was my favorite haunt and I could be found there for wine tastings each Friday and Saturday, occasionally for Sunday beer tastings, and sometimes just to stop by on off nights and sample some wines.  It was like a home away from home.  There was an ever-increasing group of regulars that lingered after the formal tastings to open bottles of wine and share with one another and with newcomers.  I met so many nice people there.  People shared wine and conversation and food.  It was a feeling of camaraderie, of family, and it extended even to the staff.  Wine tastings were held in the back corner of the store and people milled about in that close little area, lending itself to conversations and introductions and socializing in general.  That was in the days before \"Buvons\" and all the other frills.  Things have changed.  I returned to Corkscrew recently after a six month absence.  I paid $20 for a platter of three pieces of cheese, a few slices of bread, and a few apricots that cost me a mere $8 last Fall.  I was also surprised to see a charge of $2 for a glass from which to drink my wine purchase: another new fee.  Glasses were always free.  Many of the staff from my \"era\" left and management has changed.  The new manager, Todd Fusco, is a knowledgeable and personable guy who previously managed another favorite place of mine, Farren's.   He has inherited the current concept there.  He will do well because he has the savvy and personality to succeed.  Corkscrew still has their impressive selection of fine wine, craft beer, and other spirits.  It still has its weekly tastings and many new events, but people take their glass of wine and wander about the larger expanses of \"Buvons\" without the interaction of the old days.  I would hope that its staff would be as knowledgeable as those who have left.  Live music has been added, not something I particularly enjoy in some settings, like when I'm trying to enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation.  I am not necessarily resistant to change and I did make an effort when some of these changes were initiated last summer, but in my opinion the intimacy, the camaraderie has lost something in the redesign and restructure of the place.  The new Corkscrew appears successful which is nice because the people behind Corkscrew are nice people and were always good to me in the past. It's great to hear that so many people attend events there.  For me, however, it's  just not the same.  I shall always miss the old days, the little perks, the gathering of people, and the sense of belonging.  I give a rating of three stars because it still is the best wine emporium in C-U but withhold two stars for the loss of something unique and personal that it once offered.  If you were a part of that, you would understand.\n\nOn second thought . . Meh, I've experienced better.  Sadly, the \"better\" I experienced was the old Corkscrew, before this \"Buvons\" nonsense started.  I've given the new concept several tries and always come away disappointed.  It has become a cold, impersonal business.  Corkscrew has lost its soul, its heart, its spirit.  I mourn its passing.\n\nUPDATE:  Recently went to a \"wine tasting.\"  What a joke. Those participating were denied entry into the hallowed halls of \"Buvons\" and consigned to a small area near the cash registers.  I was then told that they were phasing out their weekly tastings, once the hallmark of the place and a draw for those new to wine as well as connoisseurs.  Prominently placed on the entry to said \"Buvons\" was a large, hand-drawn sign asking for a $6 cover fee.  Our group was granted a table in those hallowed halls and some bought bottles of wine to share.  I was one.  They were charging a $5 corkage fee for each bottle.  WHAT?!?!?  A corkage fee by definition is charged by a restaurant to patrons bringing their own wines.  We were buying our wines there.  When did this nonsense start?  In discussing the policy with some former regulars, I was regaled with stories of apathy by staff when asked if Corkscrew could get certain wines (which Binney's did get) as well as other costly and ludicrous changes in policy.  A pleasant wine experience has taken a back seat to live music.  In the poor acoustics of \"Buvons\" the music is loud enough yet musicians still use amps.  Conversations are impossible once the music starts, as is any enjoyment of wine and the overpriced cheese plates.  One would think staff would wear masks as they rob you blind but they feel no such need to hide their identity.  This demise of a once customer friendly, intimate wine emporium was difficult to see.  I recall my concerns when the owners planned to expand.  I said I hoped it wouldn't alter the conviviality of the place and was assured things would be the same.  Not a chance.  I read the reviews here and am astonished.  Then again, it sounds like the reviewers never knew what Corkscrew was like before greed took over.", "review_text_best": "Ah Corkscrew, my first and favorit wine store.

Out of the estimates that we received, this one was by far the best price and had the best warranty. We get a 50 year warranty! \n\nBesides the price, there were a couple other reasons that made Roof Drs the obvious choice for us: \n\n1) 50 year warranty-even if they go out of business we're still covered by manufacturer of the shingles\n2)You get a certificate with the warranty that is transferrable to the new owner if/when we sell our house\n3) they don't sub-contract (they don't use inexperienced day laborers)\n4) You don't pay any money up front, you pay when the job is done and you're satisfied with the job\n\nOur roof was put on in two and a half days.

In the big wind that we had (50 mph) on Leap Day 2012, we had some of the new shingles blow off, maybe 8 or so along where the two edges of the roof meet.

Another gentleman in my party pretty much did!  \n\nFor my entree I had the filet, the quality of meat and preparation was so nice.  The way the Chef placed the meat on top of the potatoes and asparagus was very upscale, not to mention easily the best steak I have ever had.  The potatoes & asparagus perfectly complimented the flavor of the filet.  For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake.

I'm giving two stars because this (potentially) beautiful hotel has SO much potential.  Faulty Towers meets Bates Motel, that pretty much sums up my experience.  \n\nI checked in late Friday night to be told by the nice young lady (managers daughter) that I had received an exceptional rate (of $70...) apparently meaning I should be feeling lucky, I guess?  None-the-less... check in was easy, I avoided the elevators, they're not my thing...  I took the steps to the 2nd floor, found my room, which was clean at first glance.  Checked for bed bugs, and signs of critters - all good.  Except for the random brown stain on the beds edge on the white fitted sheet.  Not sure about that one.  At closer look, the place had not been cleaned in quite a white it seemed.  There was plaster fragments all over the carpet.  The office chair was stained with so many \"substances\" that I refused to sit in it.  Still, I've experienced worse.  I finally wind down, fall asleep to the 15+ cable channels they have around 2AM or so.  I normally would have gone right to sleep by having a drink to wind down, but the bar they advertise in the pictures was CLOSED AND PADLOCKED.  So around 3:30AM I am frantically awaken by a blasting siren.  Fabulous, a fire alarm.  In a stuporous state I throw on some sort of clothing, grab my wallet, phone, and shoes, and run barefoot down the dirty stairwell to find an empty lobby.  I stand there for 10-15 minutes, one other guest appears who doesn't speak English, then about 5 minutes later (yes, 20 minutes has gone by) the manager who also speaks little English shows up from the stairwell in...in a white t-shirt and some floppy whitie-tighties.  He runs around for a while like a maniac only to come up from the basement stating it's a sprinkler pressure alarm - comforting.  I'm instructed to go back to bed and do so.  The odd part of all of this, is in 20 minutes, why was there not an automated response from the fire department?  Maybe the system isn't monitored appropriately?  \n\nI try to lay down and guess what - the next door guest arrives home, and apparently he loves to play rap music at 4AM.  After another 30 minutes of laying there upset and worked up, I pick up the phone to call the front desk... but wait!  The phone doesn't work.  It's dead.  (Like I could have been in a fire event.)  So I take matters into my own hands, bang on his door, and politely (through a glare) ask him to turn down his music, to which he reluctantly complies.  Now, time to get some rest... but wait, I can't fall asleep, because I'm burning up.  Not from the pseudo-fire, but from the fact that the nice new HVAC wall system they installed, isn't working, and just keeps beeping and saying \"P-5.\"  So, I lay in bed watching bad TV, mad at the world, until it's time for me to \"wake up\" and go to school for another 9 hour day, then drive 3 hours home, all on 3 hours of sleep.  \n\nI check out, no questions asked, no, \"How was your stay, sir?\"  I think the poor young lady already knew - since they all live there they experienced the same night I did, to an extent.  \n\nI SO WISH for this hotel to get a responsive and proactive manager, and for the owner to invest the appropriate money and amenities required to attract not only visitors, but locals to the \"bar\" that I never saw.

Salsa was a little spicy, just like it should be.", "review_text_best": "Most people can't resist the allure of cheap, fast-prepped, heaping piles of food, regardless of quality, and that's what attracts them to Mexican food.  That's what makes me despair for Mexican food.  By contrast, Cocina Real serves a decent variety of dishes with different flavors, and is just darn good food, even if it deviates from the expected combination of: Taco/Enchilada + Salty Rice + Watery Beans.  I can't say that it is the most \"authentic\" Mexican food, but the cooks here obviously play around with the flavor combinations in a way that rewards the taste-buds of their diners.\n\nThe tortilla chips are neither greasy nor salty, but coarse in texture, with a bold earthy flavor.  They remind me very much of the El Milagro Totopos tortilla chips sold at local Mexican groceries.  While others are bound to disagree, I think that the salsa at Cocina Real is the hands-down best for the Champaign area.  The tomatoes are pureed into a smooth paste with little pulp, complimented with plenty of red onion and cilantro.  I was impressed by the presence of some heat, which most restaurant salsas avoid.\n\nAs an additional appetizer, I also tried one of their specialty dips, the guacamole rostizado.  The menu advertises that guacamole will be prepared table-side, but unfortunately we didn't get to watch the complimentary performance (maybe because we were dining at an odd hour?).  Again, I was impressed by some flavors that are usually absent in standard restaurant food; in particular, the addition of lime, which gives the creamy avocado a pleasant freshness.\n\nEntrees are decently-priced.  Some run the upper range for Mexican food ($13), but there were also some equally filling dishes around $5.  My friend ordered one of their specialties, the Tacos Azteca.  Wow wow wonderful!  Battered and fried tilapia wrapped in white corn tortillas and served with creamy chipotle sauce?  YES PLEASE.  I ordered the Tamales Poblanos: formidably-large pork tamales smothered in mole sauce.  Tamales?  Flavorful, the meat slightly spicy.  I liked the mole sauce less as it was a little too sweet and gravy-like in substance (but still, they get points in my book for serving mole sauce on the menu).  My dish came with a side of fijoles charros: bean soup with bacon and salted ham.  I would have devoured a pot of those beans alone.\n\nOverall, I give this place a high score because, while their flavors are not entirely novel, they still deviate from the standard fare you'd get at other Mexican places in Champaign.

I've been going to her for about 2.5 years now and I have only had one poor experience (which was my first visit and arose from a poor explanation on my part). I'm not sure I can remember all of the items I've had her alter, but I'll try: three suits, at least 6 button-up shirts, two sweaters, about 5 pairs of pants (for one of which she excellently brought in a baggy seat), a mid-thigh trenchcoat (tricky work was required for the waist on that), a Ralph Lauren peacoat (got a size medium on clearance because I knew she would be able to perfectly trim it down to a small - I now wear it every day in the fall and winter)...you get the point. And this week I'll be taking in a seersucker suit, which needs some work in the jacket. \n\nI've recommended her work to my girlfriend, who is going back soon for a dress alteration. That reference has in turn led to several of her friends bringing Beth their business, based on my girlfriend's recommendation. \n\nShe does excellent work and has always had things ready for me in one week. Once, I asked for a rush order (+50% base cost) and when I went to pick it up on the delivery date, she didn't make me pay the rush charge because she said she had gone through her other work faster than expected. \n\nHer work isn't cheap, but I don't think it's overpriced. Plus, who would spend a good deal of money on a suit or dress or whatever and then skimp on the tailoring, only to have the work be sub-par? Tailoring is an investment and should add to the fit and appearance of your clothes, not detract.

The prices are higher, with expired food on the shelf- including milk. $9 a gallon for expired milk. I wouldn't buy anything that isn't factory sealed and dated from there if food gets left out that long- which kind of defeats the point of a natural food store, doesn't it?\n\nThey brag about their \"new\" cafe. By the way, unless they specifically say the cafe food is organic, it ISN'T. Sometimes you find some extra pricey stuff marked organic in the cafe area- that's your clue. That's the only stuff that was that day. Yep, the bakery and coffee areas say they use all organic ingredients, but the cafe doesn't.  In a \"natural\" food store. Was pretty ticked to realize that.\n\nOf course, for that to be a problem you have to find them on a day they actually opened on time. Got there once and the lights were all off, bakery and coffee open. Heard that this happens a lot, Either no one was scheduled to work the opening shift, or no one showed up for the regular store, I guess.\n\nIf you're lucky, you can be like me and  hear the \"manager\" come out and yell bizarre paranoid commands at employees and customers. Like how the employees are smiling too much. Seriously thought the dude was going to yell at me for having a good day. Really puts the $9 rotten milk in perspective. I think a lot is rotten there that we don't see.\n\nDuring the old days, used to go there about once a month for special items. Never again. Never, ever, ever, ever again.

I will preface this with saying that the new Strawberry Fields is much different than the old business. I think that almost all the improvements are positive ones but if you were head over heels in love with the old Strawberry Fields, you might want to read this whole review before you decide to go back. Also, the employees are obviously all new so, I noticed that many of them are a little confused with pricing of products and logistics but it wasn't bad enough to ruin my experience.\n\nMany of the important features of the old Strawberry Fields are still there. They still have freshly baked bread and vegan desserts. They still carry a lot of vegetarian frozen items and have a similarly sized produce section. They also carry a lot of the same \"natural brands\" like Annie's and Amy's that many old customers are probably familiar with. They also still have coffee drinks available and a sizable bulk section.\n\nThere are a few things that are different. I consider most of these things positive improvements. The biggest positive improvement for me is the little food counter where they now serve coffee. It looks like they have a really great lunch special and I can't wait to come back for lunch! I tried out the \"eggplant salad\" which I would describe as a cold casserole, was super yummy! It was creamy and had great herb and garlic flavor! I will definitely come back to try other things they have behind the counter. This is also where they have some of their vegan desserts available. I even saw sugar free cookies! Although the flavor was something with molasses so I would probably ask if they are actually diabetic friendly or if they just don't have granulated sugar. I decided to go for a piece of chocolate cake. It was so tasty and super rich! Another big improvement is that they have an olive bar over by the cheeses! The only bad change is that they now put groceries in plastic bags and they don't have those snazzy bags that say \"being green is our bag\". That's okay, I almost always bring my own bag anyway.\n\nAll in all, I would say its similar to the old location with a more international twist and an awesome spot to grab a quick meal!

We decided to embrace a restaurant with a ridiculous, punny title, and a cartoon picture of a man with a wonky, paintbrush mustache.  Great decision.\n\nThe Great Impasta is a half block east of Neil Street in downtown Champaign and despite teh fact that their outside tables were covered in construction worker dust, the staff was friendly and self-effacing enough to jokingly clean them off for us so we could enjoy the balmy Saturday evening (on nights like these, if I close my eyes, I can pretend I'm back home in San Diego, sigh).\n\nThe stuffed mushrooms were good, although not the highest quality, but the bartender was ON POINT.  I asked him on a whim to make me something \"silly and dangerous, with a hint of vanilla\" (because i'm an ass and I can ask things like this.  Don't try it at home).\n\nHe came back with a mix of kahlua, grand marnier, vanilla vodka, bailey's, and a chocolate liquor.  He then apologized for putting a bit more vodka than he planned, but it was fantastical.  We named it a \"Cow of Color,\" since brown cow sounded too...cliche.\n\nOur server, Lara, was funny, outgoing, friendly and helpful with charm and a great attitude.  She helped us choose some delicious pasta dishes that weren't too heavy and just flavorful enough, and I admit I went for a cream/chicken dish.  Whatevs.  I'll run tomorrow while hating my new waist size.\n\nMore important, however, was the slightly hilarious decor provided by one of the staff, who paints pictures, including watercolors of her fellow employees.  Imagine our surprise when Liz and I saw the busboy's painted visage staring prominently at us from a main wall.  It was more fun to pretend to be interested in buying the painting just to make him uncomfortable.\n\nThe Great Impasta lost their lease on that corner so they're only in business on Church Street until December 31.  Then the spot becomes a bank (WTF), while they hunt for a new location.  Go while you can.  The food is good, the bartenders amenable, the staff fantastic.  Go now.  Log off the damn computer, hop a flight if you have to.  I'll even pick you up from Willard airport if I have to.

The venue is awesome for just about everything.  I attend the symphony series, the chamber music series, and the ballet.  I've enjoyed some of the greats in music and dance there. The staff and volunteers are cordial and efficient.  I also attend the Salon series that showcases rising young talent who have earned prestigious awards.  This is a fun series.  The seating is limited and on the stage, up close and personal with the artist.  Prior to the performance, champagne and finger foods are served.  The food is exquisite.  After the performance, coffee and truffles or petit fours are served.  It's a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  The Promenade shop offers an array of esoteric items ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime.  Intermezzo offers some tasty sweets and savories and a yummy Jamaican coffee blend.  Only complaint here is that they only have one cashier which slows things down, especially during intermissions.  I do remember fondly the old Intermezzo that had an even wider array of decadent sweets to delight the palate and destroy the waistline.  And then there is the Stage 5 Bar.  I have sampled several of their wine offerings and can only say that I have never been able to go beyond one sip.  I have abandoned further attempts with the wine and moved on to my old standby cocktail, the Black Russian.  There is a young lady who frequently tends bar there who makes the best Black Russian.  I've yet to try the food platters at Stage 5, although I have seen them.  Meager portions.  It seems, however, that they are always out of the one(s) I want.  I am a contributor to KCPA and urge others to do likewise.  This great venue brings in a wealth of fine entertainment one would only expect to find in big cities.

Plenty of staff were manning the counters during a recent visit with my boyfriend, so our food was prepared in a timely fashion.  However, 2 different employees made our burritos, and I'd say that there was some inconsistency in technique: his was flat and floppy, mine was stout and compact.  I see the same differences at other made-to-order places (like Subway), so that might not be a fair criticism.\n\nIn terms of complaints from other Yelpers about time and efficiency, I admit that Chipotle edges out Panchero's, but the additional minute or two required to put together a burrito didn't seem unreasonable.  The time delay might be more problematic during meal crunch times; not sure that Chipotle is much better considering their lines of 20+ students when school is in session.\n\nI can't complain about food quality, especially for fast food.  Tortillas are pressed and cooked at the time of your order, which is kind of fun to watch.  I think their rice differs from the lime-cilantro recipe, but I couldn't discern any specific flavor, either.  The grilled meats and veggies are tasty, and you are offered your choice of standard toppings: pico de gallo, corn salsa, tomato salsa, sour cream, guacamole, etc.  When I requested a little more rice or salsa, employees loaded up my burrito without complaint or extra charges.   Before wrapping up your burrito, they use small spatulas to mix together ingredients so that each bite is a \"perfect\" mix of everything.\n\nFor local folk who don't have the patience for the student crowds in campustown, Panchero's is a fine alternative to Chipotle.  Prices, food quality, and environment are comparable.

The basement of the union is set up as a mall-style food court, and Crepe de Licious is just another fast food option thrown into the mix.  However, unlike the other union restaurants, which are all recognizable chains (Sbarro, Chick-Fil-A, McAllister's), Crepe de Licious is privately owned and operated (in case you care about that kind of thing).  The rest of the food court area is decorated with cheap plastic furniture, but there is a seating area adjacent to Crepe de Licious that is slightly more private and cozy.\n\nAs the name suggests, the primary menu item here are crepes with various fillings, though there are also options for burgers and beef hot dogs.  Also unlike the other restaurants in the union, Crepe de Licious offers breakfast items--if you are traveler staying at the union hotel, you will notice a distinct lack of breakfast restaurants in the campustown area, so Crepe de Licious is one of your few options.  While the crepe varieties are not particularly exciting (just variations of grilled meat, vegetables, cheese, and sauce), I do appreciate that this place uses fresh vegetables in their fillings, including baby spinach and romaine lettuce.  By the way, I am pretty sure their \"special sauce\" (advertised as a topping on most crepes) is just ranch dressing.\n\nRecently, Crepe de Licious introduced \"Bombay wraps\" to their menu.  You can choose your bread (naan or crepe), flavoring (tikka masala, madras curry, etc.), and filling (grilled veggies or meat).  My veggie bombay wrap came with crisp lettuce, grilled mushrooms and peppers, and a chopped veggie burger.  This was a very simple lunch (fairly easy to duplicate at home), but it was still filling and well-seasoned.  I would probably order it regularly when I need a quick lunch on campus.\n\nMost items on the menu cost $5 or less, which is extremely reasonable considering the location and other options at the Student Union.  Crepes, wraps, and burgers are all in the $5 range, while sides (like fries) are only $1.\n\nIf you are looking for exotic, refined crepes, I would try Carmon's in downtown Champaign.

It was still unseasonably warm, but that warmth had an odd quality to it, like it was the last gasp of summer before inevitably, inexorably sliding through the warm cheeriness of fall into the coldness of winter.  And so I sat this Sunday morning, sippin' my cafe, eyeing the clouds in the shadow of the beautiful brick Champaign County Courthouse and thinking about all the roads that had led me to this place, this time, this life.  Then i smiled, sat back and watched the dogwalkers, soccer mom's, and fellow grad students mill about me on a tranquil Sunday morning.\n\nThanks for the peaceful moment, Starbucks.  For that I'm very glad.", "review_stars_best": 4, "review_id_worst": "aAY2DkvvW9tjWAo3IFhwLA", "business_id": "cP-PK9tUbuZVmfEoWYDI9A"}, {"review_id_best": "TjnBZiGqByspIv9hu15NOg", "reviewer_name_best": "Kali", "review_stars_worst": 5, "reviewer_name_worst": "Chris", "review_text_worst": "LOVE LOVE LOVE Artmart.

Juicy, well done, charbroiled delicious MEAT (not \"meat\") patties. Solid bun, nothing fancy. American Cheese (because that's how I like it, since we ARE in America). And cheap cheap cheap.

Several of my co-tennants have made maintenance requests, and seeing that didn't work, requested that better machines be brought in.  To all our requests, management turned a deaf ear.

It took a month before the repair job was complete.  They have a landscaping crew come out every week to make sure the weed whacking is done, but if it is something inside an apartment which is being paid for by a tenant, there is absolutely no rush to get things done.  \n\nThis place is a joke.

I thus didn't get any sleep and was so exhausted that I barely could function at work the next day.  \n\n-Additionally, there were several nights where I was awakened to screaming children under the age of approx. 5 yrs old who were out on the balcony of a neighboring building.  The mother let her children scream for over an hour.  One time a dog barked straight for 2 hours.  Another, some man screamed Fu*k You at the top of his lungs for over an hour and multiple people called police.  I need my sleep to treat hospitalized patients and could not have this. These events were just a few of the many and all occurred after midnight during the middle of the workweek. \n\n-Town and Country has routinely charged late fees to my rent even after I specifically requested a bill to know my new statement (it was going to be different). They failed to do so twice in a row; instead, they waited until the rent would be considered late so they could charge late fees. \n\n-Seems like Town and Country are only interested in collecting $$$, and not taking care of their apartment buildings or the needs of tenants. \n\n-They don't care about their tenants.  Their attitude is \"too bad\".  No concept of business.  They don't value your business and seem to treat you like a number b/c they can always just get more section 8 tenants, a guaranteed check from the government. What do they care if you leave.

After the show was over, I guess the owner didn't want all the pesky customers to hang around and enjoy another drink while they talk about the magic show.

Special request Tso's Tofu looked rockin' and tasted better.\n\nThe Ma Po Tofu was a bit on the slimy side, and our party noticed some flavor balance issues in certain dishes.\n\nIt's very basic american-ized Chinese food, fairly cheap and large portions, hella quick.", "review_stars_best": 3, "review_id_worst": "E6UD_VvptFUqA0rmEW-JUA", "business_id": "eKzME8Ax_RHe1f0YmXD8tg"}, {"review_id_best": "RThdsEXG9braFhpy03wcqA", "reviewer_name_best": "Daniella", "review_stars_worst": 4, "reviewer_name_worst": "Edward", "review_text_worst": "Just had some work done at Red's.  The place has the ambiance of a hardcore auto shop.  No frills, long-dated posters and signs and photos, parts piled everywhere, old car seats to sit on while waiting.  But the people there are helpful and they do the job and at reasonable prices.  Sadly, I am not happy with the results, but that has nothing to do with Red's service.  I had some FlowMasters put on my car to increase the volume and give it a meaner sound.  However, the only place the exhaust sounds louder is in the cockpit.  It is nowhere near what I had hoped for and expected.  The fault does not lie with Red's.  They did a good job installing the mufflers.  I just should have gotten different ones. Such is life.", "review_text_best": "I just got a new muffler on my 2000 Honda Civic. Overall,  I had a good experience.  They were fast and friendly but I felt it was a little more expensive than the other reviewers lead you to think. I spent $312 on a new pipe and muffler which came with a 1 year warranty.  All around a pretty good deal at a reasonable price but not a crazy cheap deal by any means.", "review_stars_best": 4, "review_id_worst": "jKjisUhffKTCrc90DOQ8hg", "business_id": "yKgH-EgKNuCFpZp33SNxlA"}, {"review_id_best": "1zeNEbbbQsSk50X7-ntkTA", "reviewer_name_best": "Adam", "review_stars_worst": 5, "reviewer_name_worst": "Eric", "review_text_worst": "When construction delays left our organization (a fraternity at the University of Illinois) without livable space, we found ourselves in urgent need of temporary housing options. Within a matter of days, Eastland Suites stepped up with a competitive and well conceived group sales offer capable of accommodating all our current members.\n\nWhile we ultimately decided on a residential housing option, I highly recommend working with Ms. Tonia Ribbe for any hotel room block or group sales needs. Tonia was responsive, flexible and highly professional in her dealings with our organization. She was genuinely interested in our needs and situation and furnished creative solutions to comfortably house our very large group. \n\nHaving Eastland Suites as an extended hotel option gave our group peace of mind amidst an uncertain construction delay. I would encourage anyone with similar circumstances to call Tonia and consider a room block at Eastland Suites.", "review_text_best": "Wow!  This place is absolutely amazing for the price.  I paid $68 per night for a very spacious king studio w/ full kitchen and dinette.  They also have a hot breakfast buffet with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and pancakes included in the price.  Oh, and fresh pineapple too!\n\nPlus they have a large cage with a blue and gold macaw at the front entrance.  I'm always a sucker for pet parrots.", "review_stars_best": 5, "review_id_worst": "xcmMspwX0O54Canh2HaBbA", "business_id": "HKN_-ZvArer9TkHF5HXEOg"}]}
